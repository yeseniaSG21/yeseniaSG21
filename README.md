- 👋 Hi, I’m Yesenia! Welcome to my Github!
- 👀 I’m interested in combining my knowledge of data analytics with the creativity that web development provides. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working on expanding my Frontend knowledge with React.
- 📝 My goals as a developer is to hold the door open for more talented POC community members to join tech spaces. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to utlize my Github to share my projects throughout my learning trajectory as a Full Stack developer. I am open to collab with others on open source projects and for any advice on my project's code.
